    <description>ALGLIB is a cross-platform numerical analysis and data processing library. It supports several programming languages (C++, C#, Pascal, VBA) and several operating systems (Windows, Linux, Solaris). ALGLIB features include:

Data analysis (classification/regression, including neural networks)
Optimization and nonlinear solvers
Interpolation and linear/nonlinear least-squares fitting
Linear algebra (direct algorithms, EVD/SVD), direct and iterative linear solvers, Fast Fourier Transform and many other algorithms (numerical integration, ODEs, statistics, special functions)</description>

    <releaseNotes>CSV import - you can now read 2D matrix from CSV file
AGS (Adaptive Gradient Sampling) algorithm for nonsmooth nonconvex constrained optimization, which makes ALGLIB one of the few commercial packages supporting nonsmooth optimization.
Ward's method for hierarchical clustering
special lightweight linear solvers without condition number estimation and iterative refinement - orders of magnitude faster than their "feature-rich" counterparts
parallel k-means clustering (parallelism is supported only in commercial edition of ALGLIB)</releaseNotes>
